# Motte_Archibald_Comparison_project

## Analysis
In comparing Tyler Motte and Josh Archibald across the above statistics - Points per Game, Penalties in Minutes per Game, Hits per Game and Blocks per Game - it can be determined that there is strong evidence to suggest that Motte is a strong replacement for Archibald at the 4th line Right Wing position. Via linear ridge regression, with consideration of the cubic regression, the data suggests that Motte will surpass/outpus a similar points production to that of Archibald, while also significantly outperforming Archibald in Penalty Avoidance & Blocks; however, Archibald was projected to surpass Motte in Hits per 60 for the upcoming season to varying degrees.

## Conclusions
In concluding, based on the above analysis, I believe Motte is an improvement over Archibald, as shown in the projections for Blocks, Pts & PIM's per 60. Additionally, I believe the physical presence of Luke Glendening at the 4th line Center position will provide a strong physical element on the 4th line. I also personally believe Motte will overachieve the projected Hits/60 in the cubic projection and lean closer to that of the linear ridge regression projection. These projections could benefit from utilizing training data with similar 4th line-type players in the league.
